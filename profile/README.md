# Repository of collaborating on KarTup project.

## Activities which are done here
- Sharing self-written content related to the project.
- Discussing about the written stuff
- Holding the related documents of the project.

## How we work here?
1. Each member of the project will fork the main project repository and will work on the stuff s/he has to write.
2. Every change should be sent to the main repo as a **pull request**
3. Every change needed to be done will be discussed on the comment sections of the pr.

## Forking and collaboration
Because the admin of the repo is me, no one can commit or merge anything on the main repo, therefore everyone who want to participate in the project should fork the project and create a branch _with his/her name_. like: sinarabiei. Anything s/he would want to do, should be committed on his/her branch.
Then s/he will create a pull request for the changes s/he has made.
After discussing the changes that should be done to the written doc, the changes will be merged into the main branch.

## Technology 
- To create a nice and high quality documentation (in pdf format) LaTeX will be used as the main software of the project.
- The format that everyone will use for self-written document is just the simple _txt_ file. Any LaTeX related stuff will be done by me.
