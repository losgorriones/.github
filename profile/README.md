# Organization of collaborating on university project.

## Projects we work on
1. [documentation](https://github.com/losgorriones/documentation) _private_
2. _NONAME(s)_ (project(s) of computer architecture)

## General workflow
1. Each member of the project will fork the main project repository and will work on the stuff s/he has to write.
2. Every change should be sent to the main repo as a **pull request**
3. Every change needed to be done will be discussed on the comment sections of the pr.

## Forking and collaboration
Because the admin of the repos is me ([mahdihaghverdi](https://github.com/mahdihaghverdi)), no one can commit or merge anything on the **main** repo (except if there were the need to create multiple repos), therefore anyone who wants to participate in the projects should fork the projects and create a branch _with his/her name_. like: sinarabiei. Anything s/he would want to do, should be committed on his/her branch.
Then s/he will create a pull request for the changes s/he has made.
After discussing the changes that should be done to the written doc, the changes will be merged into the main branch.

## Technologies
  - ### [documentation](https://github.com/losgorriones/documentation)
    - To create a nice and high quality documentation (in pdf format) LaTeX will be used as the main software of the project.
    - The format that everyone will use for self-written document is just the simple _txt_ file. Any LaTeX related stuff will be done by me ([mahdihaghverdi](https://github.com/mahdihaghverdi)).
